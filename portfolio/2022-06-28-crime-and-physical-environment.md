Correlating crime and pysical environment was a pet project adopted into my Bachelors thesis in 2012. It used 42 different factors such as literacy rate of ward, 
percentages of land uses present, presence of lake/park/public spaces, etc. 

**Introduction, Project Details and Data**:

In 2010, Bangalore made up 1.44 % of India's cases registered under IPC and 22.6% of karnataka's total registered cases while the population of Bangalore is only 13.8% of Karnataka. What makes Bangalore special is that it is the capital of the state, it is a 'primate' city (10 times the size of the next big city, Mysore) and growing at a rapid pace. The registered cases aren't in proportion to its population. 

Crime data of theft (highest numbers among all crimes), burglary, rape, kidnapping, murder, trafficking, gambling, narcotics and others were obtained from National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) office, Land use maps of different planning districts were obtained from the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA), ward demographic data was obtained from Census of India, and several scores and physical/planning related indices were obtained from secondary source for indictors such as access to public toilets, % of green cover, cleanliness of roads, crowding in public transport, distance to closest park and playground, speed of travel (public and private transport), public amenities, street lighting, etc., which possibly had a relation to crimes. 

The biggest hurdle was not the data but the boundaries of wards, planning districts/police station zones not matching. Back then I did not statistical downscaling existed as a tool to disaggregate (even then it would have been a challenge - for such a short time), so I took all the wards that matched and took ranndom samples (stratified) from three categories: high, mid and low crime incidences. Crime data, fortunately, had spatial information (in terms of which ward/police station the crimes occured in). Along with the crime incidences, other criteria were high and low growth rates of crimes and people's perception of safety study.
