**Joining the Census of India 2001 and 2011 data**

Census of India 2001 and 2011 (and more recently even 1991) data is available online. However, the merging is a humongous task given that several districts have changed their boundaries between the two decades, names have changed. Merging the two is useful in studying trends and ~I have used it for several research works already. And while I go back to this file for merging any Census data, I thought I should put this up in public so others can use it too. 

I used several methods to do this merging - more importantly, I also did a spatial join which made joining them easier. Once I merged the file, I rarely go back to the original merging from scratch file so I might have to dig that up in case it is needed. It is also cross checked for correctness. 

Please find the csv in my github account [HERE](/assets/file/CensusMerge_2001_2011.csv)
