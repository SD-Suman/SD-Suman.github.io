**An interactive dashboard created using R Shiny**

Migration data is from the Census of India website and the data was analysed for the [publication:](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-021-01105-7) and another publication using the data is under progress as well.

For now, I have used a simple state-wise incoming and outgoing migration visualization for inter-state migration data for India.

Please note that the incoming migrants are to each districts in the state while the outgoing migrant data is only available for each state (so centroid of the state is considered).
