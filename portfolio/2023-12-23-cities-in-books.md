**A static map of cities in books from a webpage**

A previous colleague's website [CITIES IN FICTION](https://www.citiesinfiction.com/archive) gives a collection of books in which cities are mentioned. Please feel free to have a look and contribute to entries. 

I made a quick static map of cities data upto Dec 2023. This however is very quickly made so even the states (centroid) where the cities are present are also marked.

I could do a more proper job of it, with more cleaning and taking out only the cities when I get some time for it, but till then, this quick map it is!
