# [Cities in Books from a colleague's website](/portfolio/2023-12-24-Mapping-cities-in-books.md) 

A previous colleague's website [CITIES IN FICTION](https://www.citiesinfiction.com/archive) has cities mentioned which I mapped. Take a look [here](/portfolio/2023-12-23-cities-in-books.md)


# [Visualizing incoming and outgoing migrants (2011) from each state in India](/portfolio/2023-12-22-inter-state-migration-dashboard.md) 

This project made me learn so many things! Helped me collaborate with some amazing people (scientists) and produced 1 publication (and one is on the way). Visualization link in [here](/portfolio/2023-12-22-inter-state-migration-dashboard.md)


# [Does economic development translate to spatial development?](/portfolio/2022-07-15-regional-economic-growth-spatial-growth.md) 

I wanted to do a cellular automata based (complex system) urban growth model but as there was no one to guide such a project, this is the second project I could think of. It was interesting nonetheless and allowed me to work with supervised satellite imagery classification, derive a hierarchy for settlements, and work with multi-variable regression analysis to try and answer the question: 'Does economic development mean spatial development as well?'.

# [Crime and Physical Environment](/portfolio/2022-06-28-crime-and-physical-environment.md) 

This was a pet project turned into a Bachelors thesis project. It saw the correlation between crime and 42 physical factors including land use and the presence of lake/park, the literacy rate in the ward, etc.
