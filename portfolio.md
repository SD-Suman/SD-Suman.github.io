# [Gini Index and Lorenz Curve Scenarios](/portfolio/2024-08-22-gini-index.md) 

I visualized how the Lorenz curve and the gini index looked for different scenarios, by making up data using random numbers in a range in python.

# [Which districts have potential for growth according to migration patterns?](/portfolio/2024-08-08-migration-network-analysis.md) 

To learn more about Network analysis, I undertook a project to look for prominent districts based on Census of India Migration data for 2001 and 2011 using Network Analysis. This data consists of inter-state migration numbers from states to districts. I used Networkx in Python. Read more about it [here](/portfolio/2024-08-08-migration-network-analysis.md)


# [Joining the Census of India 2001 and 2011 data](/portfolio/2024-06-11-census-data-merge-2001-2011.md) 

The final result of monumental task of joining the Census of India 2001 and 2011 data - with district names and population data for both decades is put up here. Read more about it [here](/portfolio/2024-06-11-census-data-merge-2001-2011.md)


# [Cities in Books from a colleague's website](/portfolio/2023-12-23-cities-in-books.md) 

A previous colleague's website [CITIES IN FICTION](https://www.citiesinfiction.com/archive) has cities mentioned which I mapped. Take a look [here](/portfolio/2023-12-23-cities-in-books.md)


# [Visualizing incoming and outgoing migrants (2011) from each state in India](/portfolio/2023-12-22-inter-state-migration-dashboard.md) 

This project made me learn so many things! Helped me collaborate with some amazing people (scientists) and produced 1 publication (and one is on the way). Visualization link in [here](/portfolio/2023-12-22-inter-state-migration-dashboard.md)


# [Does economic development translate to spatial development?](/portfolio/2022-07-15-regional-economic-growth-spatial-growth.md) 

I wanted to do a cellular automata based (complex system) urban growth model but as there was no one to guide such a project, this is the second project I could think of. It was interesting nonetheless and allowed me to work with supervised satellite imagery classification, derive a hierarchy for settlements, and work with multi-variable regression analysis to try and answer the question: 'Does economic development mean spatial development as well?'.

# [Crime and Physical Environment](/portfolio/2022-06-28-crime-and-physical-environment.md) 

This was a pet project turned into a Bachelors thesis project. It saw the correlation between crime and 42 physical factors including land use and the presence of lake/park, the literacy rate in the ward, etc.
