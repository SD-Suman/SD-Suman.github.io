My curiosity about [complex systems](https://sd-suman.github.io/2024-10-26-Complex-Systems/) and their application in finding solutions for the intrinsically complex that is urban (social and resource utilization) systems led me to this beautiful equation. 

The equation is simple:

What makes this simple equation behave stochastically, create a bifurcation graph and go into absolute chaos after running for some time is the FEEDBACK. It runs for some time normally and the graph suddenly goes from a curve to bifurcation (2 curves), then there are more branches to this truck of the tree and more - like branches of an actual tree. Simply explained X at t of (n+1) is a result obtained from X at t of n (the previous step. A helpful way of picturing this equation is through a population growth scenario of a settlement which grows from nothing to a thriving metropolis, where the growth rate includes a floating population of tourists, short-term residents and marginal workers who come in for a few specific months to earn their living. The stochasticity over some time could be nicely explained by this.
