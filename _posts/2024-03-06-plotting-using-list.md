When I code, I generally want it to work in a way. A single goal in coding (or life) can be achieved by seevral ways - sometimes multiple efficient and non-efficient ways. Today, accidently, I plotted a line using 'list'!!!!

What makes this simple equation behave stocastically, create a bifurcation graph and go into absolute chaos after running for some time is the FEEDBACK. It runs for sometime normally and the graph suddenly goes from a curve to bifurcation (2 curves), then there are more branches to this truck of the tree and more - like branches of an actual tree. Simply explained X at t of (n+1) is a result obtained from X at t of n (the previous step. A helpful way of picturing this equation is through a population growth scenario of a settlement which grows from nothing to a thriving metropolis, where the growth rate includes floating population of tourists, short term residents and marginal workers who come in for a few specific months to earn their living. The stocasticity over a period of time could be nicely explained by this.
