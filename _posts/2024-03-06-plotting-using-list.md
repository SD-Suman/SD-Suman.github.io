Today, accidently, I plotted a line using 'list' in python!!! While wanting to get a list of 'geometries' from a road network from a geopandas dataframe, it plotted. But its a single geometry. So may not be very useful for doing a visulization of anything except maybe a single polygon (boundary). Still a surprising find!
