## A curiosity driven serendipitous journey

I got into causal inference first because I when I first got to know about how correlation is not causation, I wanted to know what is causation then - what makes it work and so on. I enrolled in a course (audit - almost always audit) about causation. But got discouraged as the prof there said: 'there is no causation without manupulation'; meaning I needed to do experiments. Turns out, you can infer causation using observational data as well. And when I heard about conterfactuals, Mind = Blown happened. This I got to know only when I wanted to work on real world data and wanted to find causation or at least relationship using network/graph data. This led me to econometrics (which I was leaning on the side anyways) and about Instrumental Variables, Difference-in-differences, and old words with somwhat newer meanings for confounders, control and treatment (which not only works for experimental data but also for observational data) and so on! For IV I needed to know more about confounders, blocking, unaccounted counfounders etc. and for DiD, I needed to know more about control and treatment groups in observational data and for causal inference in general, I needed to know about Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). 

I already know about time-series analysis, I love statistics and there is causal inference in time series as well - grager causality. Once I learn and do that project on causal inference, I am jumping into time series prediction for sure!
