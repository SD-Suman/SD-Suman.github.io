## A quick look at Natural Language Processing

I woked on Reccomender system in one of my jobs as a data scientist, which was exciting to say the least. It was an exploration into unknown tools, methods and whole different dimension of ML that I could not have even imagined before. I only knew of quantitative, spatial and time series data science before stepping into NLP but this depth into ML shows how qualitative text data can be used as quantitative when we 'vectorize' it and then there is 'semantics' which deciphers its meaning in a way only a machine can. Using NLP, I had built a few recommender systems and devised quantitative tools to evaluate each against each other. So here is a little introduction to Natural Language Processing which may help people stepping into it.
