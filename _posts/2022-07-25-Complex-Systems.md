## Complex Systems 

Towards the end of our Masters in Regional Planning, a question was asked by a guest lecture: what is regional planning? The class was silent with all brains going to every direction. Some of us, having studied planning for 6 years, had so many answers, we went silent. Complex system is one of those complex questions too. You know what it is, but there is just so much to be explained. 

#### Cellular Automata 

I came across complex systems during a bachelor's assignment on spontaneous planning. This was for a case when there are natural disasters and people from the areas had to be temporarily evacuated. The prediction for the areas, how it be done, and others could be simulated using complex system: particularly, cellular automata (CA) or even agent based modeling. CA could also be used to predict a city's growth (SLEUTH model: Slope, Land Use, Exclusion, Urban, Transportation, Hillshade) and used in so many more models.

Imagine a part of the city outskirts - plan represented in (A) and neatly boxed into grids. Some of these grids are developed shown in black shaded portion, some are free to be developed. (B) shows the area of interest: one 'cell' where we want to know if that will be developed next. In an extremely simplified CA model, that depends on the cells immediately surrounding it and nothing else. So based on such rules complex models of this type of complex system is used in SLEUTH models for predicting a city's growth spatially. 

### Other complex system science fields:

**Agent based modeling** is another super exciting area where you could, for example, get the whole (maybe macroeconomics?) from the sum of its parts (microeconomics) and it would not be a simple addition. 

**Complex Networks** is a whole another field which looks at the connectedness - through edges and nodes.

Anything that considers non-linear dynamics, chaos, scale-free, unpredictable - or at least difficult to predict, with 'stochatic' elements is included in complex systems and has a large scope of application as most real world phenomenons are complex in nature.

It has taken me long to understand some of the details and I am always learning something new (and also forgetting a few things along the way similar to my experience with statistics). While my journey has been self-taught, I believe, all you need is interest and time to pursue interesting things even if its not been a formal education.

## Power Laws

difficult to predict -- scale-free - fractals and power law 




The probability density function (PDF) of a power-law distribution is given by:

\[
P(x) = C \cdot x^{-\alpha}
\]

where:
- \( P(x) \) is the probability of observing value \( x \),
- \( C \) is a normalization constant,
- \( x \) is the variable (e.g., size or frequency),
- \( \alpha \) is the power-law exponent, a parameter that dictates the distributionâ€™s "heaviness" of the tail.

For continuous \( x \geq x_{\min} \):

\[
P(x) = \frac{\alpha - 1}{x_{\min}^{\alpha - 1}} \cdot x^{-\alpha}
\]

where:
- \( x_{\min} \) is the minimum value for which the power-law holds.
