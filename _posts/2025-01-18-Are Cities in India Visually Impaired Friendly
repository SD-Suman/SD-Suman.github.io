## Visual impairment in numbers:

Worldwide, the proportion of total blindness is **0.55%**, and about **7%** of the population have mild to moderate vision impairment [1]. In India, these proportions are higher: **0.9%** and **10.6%**, respectively [2]. While it affects people of all age groups, the majority of the people are over 50 [3]. In Indian cities, this proportion is expected to be higher as people flock to cities for employment opportunities, infrastructure, and services such as better healthcare and educational facilities catering to the visually impaired people.

While the proportion of visually impaired people is small, the question arises: why should we plan and design our cities to be more accessible for the small proportion of the population that is blind? In light of the resources and costs that designing inclusive cities incurs, is it reasonable to cater to this population at all?

## Why design and plan visual impairment-friendly cities?

Simply put, it is **humanitarian**, a **basic right** of everyone, and socially inclusive to all disabilities, including visual impairment. It also has a **compounding effect** as ‘barrier-free’ design is widely inclusive:

- Providing universal ease of access for all age groups and genders.
- Especially helpful for other disabilities, such as people who use wheelchairs.
- Helpful for the elderly, women, parents with strollers, and children.
- Beneficial for people with temporary illnesses or injuries.

**Cost considerations:** Although the initial investment may be higher, the long-term **economic benefits** for all age groups and people with disabilities, along with improved ease of access, far outweigh the costs of not planning and designing for inclusivity.

## What is barrier-free design?

**Barrier-free design** refers to the design of environments, buildings, or products such that they are safe to access and unhindered by obstacles for movement for everyone, regardless of disabilities, age, gender, etc. [4].

### In the built environment:
- **Indoors** (e.g., schools, hospitals, transport stations):
  - Adequate space for wheelchair access and walking with white sticks/crutches.
  - Tactile markings on the floor.
- **Outdoors** (e.g., streets):
  - Footpaths without bollards or barriers, with predictable flow.
  - Ramps at grade differences.
  - Traffic signal crossings with sound.
  - Signages (preferably symbols) with tactile markings.
  - Handrails where necessary.

For mild to moderate vision impairment:
- Hoardings and signages should be placed at certain heights and with specific text sizes to ensure visibility.

These features must be incorporated into policies and planning through:
- **Laws**.
- **Building bylaws**.
- **Development control regulations**.
- **Design manuals and guides**.
- **Building approval stages**.

## What are the policy provisions for blind-friendly cities?

India has several provisions in place:

- **The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPWD Act, 2016)**: Forms a legal basis for inclusive planning and design [6].
- **The National Building Code (NBC)**: Provides comprehensive guidelines for designing disabled-friendly built spaces [8].

## What about the design implementation?

Despite policy provisions, the on-ground situation is disappointing. While spaces like city metro stations follow barrier-free design standards, streets and footpaths remain difficult to navigate even for the able-bodied. Common issues include:
- Cost constraints.
- Negligence.
- Constant repair and maintenance in rapidly growing cities.

## Examples of Best Practices and Practices to Avoid

| Sl. No | Best Practices                                                                                     | Practices to Avoid                                                                                 |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Footpaths with tactile markings: straight dashed lines for safe direction and dotted markings for caution. Accessible and barrier-free. | TenderSure roads in Bangalore: Bollards to dissuade two-wheelers make footpaths inaccessible.   |
| 2      | Grade-separated footpaths with ramps and safe islands.                                            | Dangerous crossings without tactile markings or zebra crossings.                                |
| 3      | Barrier-free road stretches, e.g., Aundh, Pune.                                                   | Discontinued, encroached, or poorly maintained footpaths.                                       |

## What else can help provide solutions?

### Addressing gaps:
- Map streets and spaces with disability-friendly infrastructure to identify gaps.
- Create tactile maps for visually impaired users.

### Awareness:
- Start awareness programs at schools to sensitize children and families.
- Encourage citizens to demand better urban designs.

### Stakeholder involvement:
- Engage visually impaired individuals during the planning stages to understand their challenges [9].
